DaemonSet
====================
pod automaticaly will create whenever the node is added automatically 

DaemonSet
A DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod. As nodes are added to the cluster, Pods are added to them. As nodes are removed from the cluster, those Pods are garbage collected. Deleting a DaemonSet will clean up the Pods it created.

Some typical uses of a DaemonSet are:

running a cluster storage daemon on every node
running a logs collection daemon on every node
running a node monitoring daemon on every node


Fluentd is an open source data collector, which lets you unify the data collection and consumption for a better use and understanding of data

here it not is menation how many replica required but other controler it will there 
it will define based of number of node in env 

kubectl get ds -w -n kube-system
kubectl get pod -w -n kube-system
kubectl delete ds fluentd-elasticsearch  -n kube-system
kubectl describe pods - fluentd-elasticsearch-8smtx  -n kube-system
added new node
===============

kubeadm token create --print-join-command

daemon set will create one pod per node 

this will run your master node as well
